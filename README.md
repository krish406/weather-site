# Forecast Finer
Forecast Finder is a website that allows you to get weather data from any location. The website is built with React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, the OpenWeatherMap API and the Geocoding API. 

# Usage
You can enter in any address and search to get the closest match. The site will display the temperature, weather conditions, humidity, sea level, ground level, air pressure and elevation.  
If you don't get the data for the location you are looking for, you may need to be more specific with your request. For example an input of "Naples" will give you weather data from "Naples, Italy", but if you were looking for weather from "Naples, Florida" you would need to search for "Naples, Florida".

Note that submitting the first request will take approximately 30s as Render needs to build the environment to send API requests. All subsequent searches will be faster.
